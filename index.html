                    // and we want to make a copy of it.
                    // You might think we can just do something like this:

                    // however what happens when we update that array?
                    let team = players;
                    console.log(players, team);// ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] , ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

                      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
                      // note it updates the refrences even if players was updated team will still get  updated also
                                    
                      // now here is the problem!


                      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

                      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

                      // one way
                      //is using the splice method
                       let  team2 = players.slice();//if splice Start and End points are not given it returns a  copy of the array.
                       //lets try to update our team2 and see if it gets updated withouth chaning the array
                       console.log(players, team2);
                       team2[0] = 'henry';

                       // or create a new array and concat the old one in

                       team3[0] = 'Stefan';
                       console.log(players, team3);// we updated the team3 array withouth affecting the players array

                        // or use the new ES6 Spread
                        //the spread syntax [...array] spread all items in the array in the new one 
                        let team4 = [...players];
                        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
                        team4[0] = 'jaja';
                        console.log(players, team4);
                        // we updated the team4 array withouth affecting the players array

                         // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

                          // with Objects

                          // and think we make a copy:

                             name :'stephen',

                         };
                                 // with Objects

                        // and think we make a copy:

                        // how do we take a copy instead?

                         //we can use the object.assign()

                         //  used to copy properties of an object to another  syntax Object.assign({copyingto}, copyinf-from,{adding more properties});
                         let cap1 =  Object.assign({}, person, {number :99});
                         console.log(cap1);
                         //succesfully updated  withouth changing the value of the person object

                         //or you can  ...spread into an object too
                         let cap2 = {...person};
                          cap2.gender = 'male';
                          console.log(person, cap2);

                          //all this method are shallow meaning they don't go deep into nested object properties

                          let wes = {
                              name : 'tonia',
                              age : 22,
                              details:{
                                  username: 'Sexy Diva',
                                  gender: 'female'

                              }
                          }

                          let testObj = Object.assign({}, wes);
                          testObj.details.username = 'Itz favy';
                          console.log(wes , testObj);
                          /*you can see that the result of the console updates the username of the testObj and the wes object also thereby
                           they are all shallow method and nested properties if changed will be updated in both places
                          */

                          //but you can use deep-cloning but it's better you use this below
                          let testObj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
